# Nathan's Now Playing

## Tech stack
The app is written entirely in JavaScript, using React for the frontend and Express for the backend. Tailwind is used for styling.  

The plan is to have this site running in kiosk mode on a Raspberry Pi 4 with a 7" touchscreen display that sits on my desk.

## Project origin
I came across a [similar project](https://ashcroft.dev/blog/nowify-spotify-now-playing-raspberry-pi/) called [Nowify](https://github.com/jonashcroft/Nowify) by Jon Ashcroft and thought that building my own version of it would teach me a fair bit about Express, as well as refreshing my React skills and being something that I would genuinely use every day.
